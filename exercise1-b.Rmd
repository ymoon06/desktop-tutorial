```

## Create 100 samples from a log normal distribution



```{r samples}
set.seed(6)
x <- rlnorm(100, meanlog = 1, sdlog = 0.25)
print(x)
```


## Create a histogram of the distribution and the distribution on the log scale
```{r histX}
hist(x, main= paste("Histogram of samples from log normal distribution"))
hist(log(x),main=paste("Histogram of samples from log normal distribution on log scale"))
```




## report mean and variance of the sample in line in the text.

```{r}
print(mean(x))
print(var(x))
print(sd(x))


mean.samples<-mean(x)
variance.samples<-var(x)
```

mean of samples is `r mean.samples`
and variance of samples is `r variance.samples`
