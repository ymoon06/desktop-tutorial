# Exercise 2-b

## write ~2 sentences about what the method does

ChIPSeq is a method used to identify the regions of DNA that binds to DNA-associated proteins.
For any protein of interest, ChIPSeq can be used to map global binding sites for that protein.

## make the link(technology->application->statistics)


ChIPSeq->discovery of new regulatory elements that interacts with protein of interest->hypothesis testing (p-value) from for example poisson distribution (use peak calling algorithm for this).
